# Building the macOS Installer Package

This guide explains how to build the novacom/novacomd installer package on any Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon).

## Important: Code Signing

**The build script automatically signs all binaries and libraries.** This fixes the issue where novacomd would be "instantly killed" when installed on other Macs. See [Code Signing and Distribution](#code-signing-and-distribution-guide) at the end of this document for details.

## Prerequisites

1. **Homebrew** installed from [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
2. **libusb and libusb-compat** installed via Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install libusb libusb-compat
   ```
3. **Built binaries** for novacom and novacomd:
   ```bash
   # Build novacomd
   cd novacomd
   ./build.sh
   cd ..

   # Build novacom
   cd novacom
   ./build.sh
   cd ..
   ```

## Building the Installer

Simply run the build script:

```bash
./build-driver-installer-mac.sh
```

The script will:
1. Detect your architecture (Intel x86_64 or Apple Silicon arm64)
2. Locate Homebrew and verify libusb libraries
3. Copy binaries and libraries
4. Relink libraries to use `/usr/local/lib` instead of Homebrew paths
5. **Sign all binaries and libraries** (fixes "instantly killed" issue on other Macs)
6. Create the postinstall script
7. Build the installer package

## Output

The script creates an architecture-specific package, depending on the environment you run the script on:
- **Apple Silicon**: `novacom-installer-arm64.pkg`
- **Intel Mac**: `novacom-installer-x86_64.pkg`

## What the Script Does

### 1. Architecture Detection
Automatically detects whether you're on Intel or Apple Silicon and adjusts Homebrew paths accordingly:
- Apple Silicon: `/opt/homebrew`
- Intel: `/usr/local`

### 1.5. Code Signing Detection
Checks for Developer ID certificate:
- **If found**: Uses Developer ID for professional signing
- **If not found**: Uses ad-hoc signing (still works, may show warnings)

This ensures binaries work on **all Macs**, not just the build machine.

### 2. File Collection
Copies:
- `novacomd/build-novacomd/novacomd`
- `novacom/build-novacom/novacom`
- `novacom/scripts/novaterm`
- Homebrew's libusb-compat and libusb libraries

### 3. Library Relinking
Uses `install_name_tool` to update library paths:
- Changes libusb references from Homebrew paths to `/usr/local/lib`
- Updates novacomd to use bundled libraries
- Cross-links libusb-compat and libusb

### 3.5. Code Signing
**Critical for distribution!** After relinking, all binaries are re-signed:
- Signs libraries first (dependencies)
- Then signs binaries that use them
- Uses Developer ID if available, otherwise ad-hoc signing
- Verifies all signatures are valid

Without this step, binaries would be killed instantly on other Macs.

### 4. Package Creation
Creates a `.pkg` installer with:
- Payload files in proper directory structure
- Postinstall script that sets up the launchd service
- Proper permissions and ownership

## Verification

After building, verify the package:

```bash
# Check package signature
pkgutil --check-signature novacom-installer-*.pkg

# List package contents
pkgutil --payload-files novacom-installer-*.pkg

# View library dependencies
otool -L installer-package/payload/usr/local/bin/novacomd
```

## Building on Different Architectures

### On Apple Silicon Mac

```bash
./build-driver-installer-mac.sh
# Creates: novacom-installer-arm64.pkg
```

### On Intel Mac

```bash
./build-driver-installer-mac.sh
# Creates: novacom-installer-x86_64.pkg
```

## Distributing Both Architectures

For universal distribution, build on both architectures:

1. **Build on Apple Silicon Mac** → `novacom-installer-arm64.pkg`
2. **Build on Intel Mac** → `novacom-installer-x86_64.pkg`
3. Distribute both packages, or users can choose the appropriate one

Alternatively, create a distribution package that includes both as choices (advanced).

## Troubleshooting

### Script fails with "novacomd binary not found"
Build novacomd first:
```bash
cd novacomd
./build.sh
```

### Script fails with "libusb-compat not found"
Install the required libraries:
```bash
brew install libusb libusb-compat
```

### Script fails with "Homebrew not found"
Install Homebrew:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Package build fails
Make sure you have Xcode Command Line Tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Script Output

The build script provides detailed output showing:
- Architecture detection
- File verification
- Library relinking operations
- Package contents
- Installation instructions

Example output:
```
==========================================
  novacom/novacomd Installer Builder
==========================================

[INFO] Architecture: arm64
[SUCCESS] Homebrew found at /opt/homebrew
[INFO] Checking for required binaries...
[SUCCESS] Found novacomd
[SUCCESS] Found novacom
[SUCCESS] Found novaterm
...
[SUCCESS] Package built successfully!
```

## Clean Build

To clean all build artifacts and rebuild from scratch:

```bash
# Clean installer package directory
rm -rf installer-package
rm -f novacom-installer-*.pkg

# Rebuild binaries (optional)
cd novacomd && ./build.sh clean && ./build.sh && cd ..
cd novacom && ./build.sh clean && ./build.sh && cd ..

# Rebuild package
./build-driver-installer-mac.sh
```

## Advanced: Customization

To customize the installer, edit these sections in `build-driver-installer-mac.sh`:

### Change package identifier or version

Both live in the configuration block near the top of the script, and are passed
through to `pkgbuild`:

```bash
PKG_IDENTIFIER="com.palm.novacom"
PKG_VERSION="3.1.0"
```

`PKG_VERSION` tracks the webOS release these drivers ship alongside — webOS CE
3.1.0 — so that "which novacom do I need for CE 3.1.0?" has an obvious answer.
The drivers themselves are not OS-specific and work with webOS 1.x/2.x/3.0.5
devices too.

**Bump `PKG_VERSION` whenever the payload changes**, even if the OS release has
not moved. macOS keys its upgrade behaviour off this value, so shipping two
different payloads under one version leaves an installed package
indistinguishable from an older one:

```bash
pkgutil --pkg-info com.palm.novacom
```

Note this is distinct from `com.palm.novacomd`, the launchd daemon label used
for the background service.

### Change install location
The binaries install to `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/lib`. To change this, you'll need to modify:
1. The payload directory structure
2. The library relinking paths
3. The postinstall script paths

## Files Created

The build script creates:
```
installer-package/
├── payload/
│   └── usr/
│       └── local/
│           ├── bin/
│           │   ├── novacomd
│           │   ├── novacom
│           │   └── novaterm
│           └── lib/
│               ├── libusb-0.1.4.dylib
│               └── libusb-1.0.0.dylib
└── scripts/
    └── postinstall

novacom-installer-{arch}.pkg  (final package)
```

## License

The build script is provided as-is for building installers for novacom/novacomd.

# Code Signing and Distribution Guide

## The Problem

When you modify binaries with `install_name_tool` (as we do to relink the libusb libraries), it invalidates their code signatures. On modern macOS:

- **Same Mac**: Unsigned/modified binaries may work locally
- **Other Macs**: macOS immediately kills unsigned binaries for security reasons

This is why novacomd was being "instantly killed" on the other Apple Silicon Mac.

## The Solution: Code Signing

The updated `build-driver-installer-mac.sh` script now automatically signs all binaries and libraries after relinking them.

### Ad-hoc Signing (Default)

If you don't have a Developer ID certificate, the script uses **ad-hoc signing** (signature with `-`):

```bash
codesign --force --sign "-" /path/to/binary
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works immediately, no certificate needed
- ✅ Binaries will run on other Macs
- ✅ Free

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Users may see warnings on first launch
- ⚠️ May need to approve in System Settings > Privacy & Security
- ⚠️ Cannot be notarized by Apple

### Developer ID Signing (Recommended for Distribution)

If you have an Apple Developer ID certificate ($99/year), the script automatically detects and uses it:

**Pros:**
- ✅ No warnings for users
- ✅ Can be notarized by Apple
- ✅ Professional distribution
- ✅ Users trust it more

**Cons:**
- 💰 Requires $99/year Apple Developer membership
- 📝 More complex setup

## How the Build Script Handles Signing

The script automatically:

1. **Detects signing identity**:
   ```bash
   security find-identity -v -p codesigning
   ```

2. **Uses Developer ID if available**:
   - Script finds: "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM123)"
   - Uses it automatically

3. **Falls back to ad-hoc signing**:
   - If no Developer ID found
   - Still allows binaries to run on other Macs

4. **Signs in correct order**:
   - Libraries first (libusb-1.0.0.dylib → libusb-0.1.4.dylib)
   - Then binaries that depend on them (novacomd, novacom)

5. **Verifies all signatures**:
   - Confirms each file is properly signed
   - Reports any issues

## Verification

### Check if binaries are signed:

```bash
codesign -dvvv /usr/local/bin/novacomd
```

Look for:
- **Ad-hoc signed**: `Signature=adhoc`
- **Developer ID signed**: `Authority=Developer ID Application: Your Name`

### Verify signature is valid:

```bash
codesign --verify --verbose /usr/local/bin/novacomd
```

Should output: `/usr/local/bin/novacomd: valid on disk`

### Check all signatures in package:

```bash
pkgutil --expand novacom-installer-arm64.pkg expanded_pkg
codesign -dvvv expanded_pkg/Payload
```

## Distribution Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Personal/Internal Use (Ad-hoc Signing)

**Who**: Hobbyists, internal company use, small teams

**How**: Just run `./build-driver-installer-mac.sh` (no certificate needed)

**User Experience**:
1. Install package normally
2. First time running novacomd: May see warning in System Settings
3. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
4. Click "Allow Anyway" next to novacomd warning
5. Works normally after that

### Scenario 2: Public Distribution (Developer ID Signing)

**Who**: Public releases, app store alternative, professional distribution

**Requirements**:
1. Apple Developer account ($99/year)
2. Developer ID Application certificate installed

**How**:
1. Get Developer ID from Apple Developer portal
2. Download and install certificate to Keychain
3. Run `./build-driver-installer-mac.sh` (auto-detects certificate)
4. Optionally notarize: `xcrun notarytool submit novacom-installer-arm64.pkg`

**User Experience**:
- No warnings
- Installs smoothly
- Professional experience

## Setting Up Developer ID (Optional)

If you want to do proper signing for distribution:

### 1. Join Apple Developer Program

Visit: https://developer.apple.com/programs/

Cost: $99/year

### 2. Create Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

```bash
# Open Keychain Access app
# Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority
# Fill in your info, select "Saved to disk"
```

### 3. Create Developer ID Certificate

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates
2. Click "+" to create new certificate
3. Select "Developer ID Application"
4. Upload your CSR file
5. Download the certificate
6. Double-click to install in Keychain

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

Should show:
```
1) ABC123DEF456 "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM123)"
```

### 5. Build Installer

```bash
./build-driver-installer-mac.sh
```

Script will automatically detect and use your Developer ID!

## Notarization (Advanced)

For maximum trust, you can notarize your package with Apple:

```bash
# Upload for notarization
xcrun notarytool submit novacom-installer-arm64.pkg \
  --apple-id "your@email.com" \
  --team-id "TEAM123" \
  --password "app-specific-password" \
  --wait

# Check status
xcrun notarytool info <submission-id> \
  --apple-id "your@email.com" \
  --team-id "TEAM123" \
  --password "app-specific-password"

# Staple notarization to package
xcrun stapler staple novacom-installer-arm64.pkg
```

**Note**: Notarization requires Developer ID signing first.

## Troubleshooting

### "novacomd was killed" on other Mac

**Cause**: Binaries not signed or signature invalid

**Solution**: Rebuild with updated `build-driver-installer-mac.sh` script

### "Developer ID not found" but I have one

**Check Keychain**:
```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

If not listed, re-download certificate from Apple Developer portal.

### "code signature invalid" error

**Cause**: Binary modified after signing

**Solution**: Don't modify binaries after signing. The script signs at the end of the build process.

### User sees "Apple cannot check for malicious software"

**Cause**: Ad-hoc signed (not notarized)

**Solution**: Either:
1. User clicks "Open Anyway" in System Settings
2. Or get Developer ID and optionally notarize

### Signature verification fails

```bash
codesign --verify --verbose /usr/local/bin/novacomd
```

If it fails, rebuild:
```bash
./build-driver-installer-mac.sh
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always sign**: The updated script does this automatically
2. **Sign after all modifications**: Script signs after install_name_tool
3. **Sign dependencies first**: Libraries before binaries that use them
4. **Verify signatures**: Check codesign output in script
5. **Test on another Mac**: Before distributing widely
6. **Consider Developer ID**: For professional distribution
7. **Document for users**: Include installation instructions

## What Changed in build-driver-installer-mac.sh

The script now includes:

```bash
# Sign libraries first (dependencies)
codesign --force --sign "$SIGNING_IDENTITY" libusb-1.0.0.dylib
codesign --force --sign "$SIGNING_IDENTITY" libusb-0.1.4.dylib

# Sign binaries
codesign --force --sign "$SIGNING_IDENTITY" novacomd
codesign --force --sign "$SIGNING_IDENTITY" novacom

# Verify all signatures
codesign --verify --verbose [each file]
```

This ensures all binaries work on any Mac, not just the build machine.

## Summary

| Signing Type | Cost | User Experience | Best For |
|-------------|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Ad-hoc** (default) | Free | May see warning | Personal use, testing |
| **Developer ID** | $99/year | No warnings | Public distribution |
| **Developer ID + Notarized** | $99/year + time | Seamless | Professional releases |

The updated build script handles all of this automatically - just run `./build-driver-installer-mac.sh` and it will sign with the best available method.
